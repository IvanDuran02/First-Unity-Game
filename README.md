# First-Unity-Game
Had a lot of fun making this as I even went through the trouble to learn a bit of 3D modeling to make a character to control.

Definetly incomplete, what I did here was made basic scripts to walk around, sprint, jump, move camera around etc.
Also added Health that was interactable; if you collied with objects you would be damanged but would proceed to the next level if all where broken.

All in all this project took me a lot of time but was very fun learning how modeling and game scripts work!
